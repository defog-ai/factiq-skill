# Report JSON local output format

A FactIQ report object contains a summary, sections of narrative and charts,
source details, lineage, and optional methodology notes. Save it as local JSON
and render its charts with `term_chart.py`.

A recommended wrapper is:

```
question: "How has US unemployment evolved since 2022?"
report:   { summary, sections, methodology_notes? }
model:    "model name"
```

`model` is a free-text label for who authored the report — pass your own
model name.

## Report structure

```json
{
  "summary": "2–4 crisp sentences. Each sentence renders as its own summary bullet.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Section title",
      "narrative": "Plain-text paragraph(s) shown beside the section's charts.",
      "charts": [ { ...chart... } ]
    }
  ],
  "methodology_notes": "Optional caveats: adjustments, survey vintages, definitions."
}
```

- `summary` — required, ≤5,000 chars. Rendered as bullets, one per sentence.
- `sections` — 1–12 (2–5 is the sweet spot). Each needs a `heading`;
  `narrative` and `charts` are optional per section, but the report as a
  whole needs **at least one data chart** (text panels don't count toward
  that minimum) and at most **16 charts total**.
- `narrative` — **plain text, no markdown**: the report page renders it
  verbatim, so `**bold**` shows literal asterisks. ≤30,000 chars.

## Charts

`chart_type`: `line | bar | table | text | bubble | small_multiples |
stacked_area | map | heatmap`. **Stick to `line`, `bar`, `table`, and
`text`** — the first three take the simple tabular format below, and `text`
is the prose panel documented after it. The other types pass through with the
in-house agent's full hydrated config structure, which is not documented
here. For a geographic finding, build a separate ChartSpec map using
`references/output/chart-spec.md` and reference its local path in the narrative.

Tabular chart fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `chart_type` | yes | `line`, `bar`, or `table` |
| `title` | yes | The finding, with numbers — same rules as ChartSpec titles |
| `columns` | yes | Column names, ≤40 |
| `data` | yes | Rows, ≤1,200: arrays matching `columns` **or** objects keyed by column name |
| `x_column` | line/bar | One of `columns` (tables default to the first column) |
| `y_columns` | line/bar | Subset of `columns` (tables default to the rest) |
| `units` | no | Y-axis label, e.g. `"Percent"` |
| `subtitle` | no | E.g. `"Seasonally adjusted, monthly"` |
| `annotations` | no | `[{"date": "<x value>", "text": "..."}]`, used sparingly |
| `sources` | recommended | See below |
| `lineage` | recommended | See below |
| `generation_methodology` | no | One sentence on how the data was assembled |

For time series, `x_column` values should be ISO date strings sorted
ascending — some endpoints return reverse-chronological rows, which would
render a backwards x-axis. Use `null` for gaps; don't drop rows. More than
~300 points per line renders slowly — thin to monthly/quarterly first.

For table or data-excerpt row granularity, match the rows to the question and
time window. Monthly rows can be sensible for shorter multi-year windows,
roughly up to 3-5 years, when timing, seasonality, or turning points matter.
For longer windows, especially 5+ years, monthly rows often make tables too
noisy; usually summarize with annual totals, YTD comparisons, latest/prior
snapshots, or selected turning points instead. Do not default categorically to
monthly or yearly rows.

### Text panels

A `text` chart is a **prose panel**: a titled block of one to a few paragraphs
that occupies a slot in the report flow like a chart. Use it for qualitative
content — policy context, caveats, interpretation, "what to watch" — that has
no numbers to plot. **Never build a table whose cells are sentences**; if a
cell wouldn't fit on one line, it isn't table data — write a text panel.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `chart_type` | yes | `text` |
| `title` | yes | The takeaway, stated like a chart title |
| `body` | yes | Plain text, ≤4,000 chars; blank lines separate paragraphs |
| `subtitle` | no | One line of framing |
| `sources` | recommended | Same format as chart sources |

```json
{
  "chart_type": "text",
  "title": "Policy easing lowers friction, but it does not explain the surge",
  "subtitle": "What the diplomatic thaw does and does not tell us",
  "body": "First paragraph of plain text.\n\nSecond paragraph.",
  "sources": [{ "name": "Ministry of Commerce", "type": "web" }]
}
```

Text panels don't satisfy the report's at-least-one-chart requirement, and
they aren't a second narrative — keep the section `narrative` for reading the
section's charts, and use a text panel when the prose *is* the panel.

### Quote panels

A `quote` chart is an **attributed-quote panel**: a titled group of 1–8
related verbatim quotes (the home for `search_earnings_transcripts`
`verbatim_quote` values). Quoted speech never goes in a text panel body or
the narrative — it renders here with speaker attribution and a source line.
Quotes must be verbatim; give the words only (no surrounding quotation
marks — the page adds typographic quotes).

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `chart_type` | yes | `quote` |
| `title` | yes | The takeaway the quotes support, stated like a chart title |
| `quotes` | yes | 1–8 items, each `{quote, speaker, speaker_role?, affiliation?, context?, source_label?}`; `quote` ≤1,000 chars, `speaker` required |
| `subtitle` | no | One line of framing, e.g. the call being quoted |
| `sources` | recommended | Same format as chart sources |

Per-quote fields: `speaker_role` ("CEO", "cfo" — rendered uppercased),
`affiliation` ("Micron (MU)" or the analyst's firm), `context` (a short
kicker like "On HBM supply"), `source_label` (the citation line, e.g.
"MU FY2026Q3 earnings call · Q&A" — compose it from `reporting_ticker`,
`fiscal_period`, and `section`).

```json
{
  "chart_type": "quote",
  "title": "Micron on HBM supply and cash generation",
  "subtitle": "MU FY2026Q3 earnings call",
  "quotes": [
    {
      "quote": "The last two quarters, we've generated as much as the company's history.",
      "speaker": "Mark Murphy",
      "speaker_role": "cfo",
      "affiliation": "Micron (MU)",
      "context": "On record cash flow",
      "source_label": "MU FY2026Q3 earnings call · Q&A"
    }
  ],
  "sources": [{ "name": "FactIQ earnings-transcript intelligence", "type": "database" }]
}
```

Attribute honestly: check the claim row's `assertion_status` and never
present an `analyst_hypothesized` quote as management's own words — attribute
it to the analyst. Like text panels, quote panels don't satisfy the
at-least-one-chart requirement.

### Sources

```json
"sources": [
  {
    "name": "Bureau of Labor Statistics",
    "program": "Current Population Survey",
    "type": "database",
    "urls": ["/series/bls::LNS14000000"],
    "titles": ["Unemployment Rate (LNS14000000)"]
  }
]
```

`name` is required; `type` is `database | web | derived` (default
`database`). For `database` sources, `urls` are site-relative series links
(`/series/{schema}::{series_id}`) with matching `titles`. Use `derived` for
metrics you computed (YoY, indexed, ratios) and `web` for web research.

### Lineage

Same DAG format as ChartSpec lineage (see `references/output/chart-spec.md` —
nodes with `id`, `type`, `title`, `summary`, `detail`, `inputs`, optional
`code`/`code_language`/`series_refs`, exactly one `output` node referenced
by `root_id`). Record the SQL and computations you actually ran. A chart
uploaded without `lineage` gets a one-node "uploaded chart data" stub, so
the panel still renders — but says nothing useful.

Two rules carry over from chart-spec lineage and are worth repeating
because reports get them wrong most often:

- `code` renders verbatim in a code block — write it as **formatted,
  multi-line** SQL/Python with real newlines (`\n` in the JSON string),
  never collapsed onto one line. For `code`-type nodes include the actual
  script lines you ran, not a one-line paraphrase.
- `series_refs` lists **every** series the step used (each id in the
  query's `IN (...)` list or filter, with its real title), not a single
  representative one. Each ref renders as a clickable series link. For
  very large aggregates (40+ series), list the largest contributors and
  state the full count in `summary`.

## Validation and limits

Validate the required fields locally before rendering. Recommended limits are
12 sections, 16 charts, 1,200 rows and 40 columns per chart, 30,000 characters
per narrative, and 5,000 characters for the summary.

## Workflow

1. Do the full data work first with the MCP tools (`get_data_catalog` →
   `search_datasets` / `describe_dataset` → `run_sql` / `get_series` → compute
   locally). Every number in the report must come from data you fetched this
   session. Results cap at 50 rows — aggregate in SQL to the granularity each
   chart needs (a report chart wants ≤300 points anyway).
2. Outline: 2–5 section claims, one or two charts each that prove the claim.
3. Build the report object from the fetched values — assemble it in context, or
   write the data arrays with the Write tool / a small local Python script;
   don't hand-type data rows.
4. Save the report object or a wrapper such as
   `{"question": "...", "report": {...}}` to JSON.
5. Render terminal previews from the saved report JSON:
   `python3 "{plugin_root}/scripts/term_chart.py" report --report <file> --charset ascii --color never`
6. Return the JSON path, key findings, and terminal previews.

## Specialized report patterns

Broad analytical questions follow the dialectical method in
`references/report-patterns/README.md` — thesis, antithesis, synthesis — and
covered domains (bilateral trade, bilateral economic policy, monetary policy,
fiscal-policy revenue, business formation) must additionally meet the
required coverage of the playbook that README routes to. Structurally: the
summary and chart titles carry the synthesis, sections stage the headline
reading against its strongest fetched contradiction, and the closing section
or methodology notes name what to watch — the series that would overturn the
reading.
