# Bilateral Trade Report Pattern

Use this guide for broad country-pair merchandise trade questions, especially
phrases like "latest trend in trade between A and B", "what is driving trade",
"trade balance between A and B", or "compare exports and imports between A and
B". Unless the user explicitly asks for one quick chart, treat these as
report-style requests and build a compact local report.

Do not use this file alone for broad "trade policy" or "economic policy"
questions. Those questions need the wider concept checklist in
`bilateral-economic-policy.md`, including services trade, FDI/investment,
tariff and non-tariff barriers, bilateral talks, sector strategy, and
third-country policy pressure. Use this file only for the merchandise-goods
portion of those reports.

Read `references/output/report-spec.md` before authoring the report object. This file covers the
extra data work and caveats that bilateral trade reports need.

## Minimum answer

A good bilateral trade report should include:

- Latest available month for each source, with exact month and coverage.
- Latest month versus the same month one year earlier.
- Year-to-date (YTD) totals through the latest common month versus prior-year
  YTD.
- Previous full-year context, usually the prior 2-3 years.
- Exports, imports, total trade, and trade balance. State the reporter view:
  reporter exports minus reporter imports.
- Product or industry driver tables for both directions of trade, at one HS
  level, with HS code, product label, current value, prior-year value, change,
  and contribution to the net change.
- A policy-context section based on current official sources when policy could
  affect the trend.
- Source caveats, especially when using mirror statistics from both reporters.

The default report shape is 3-4 sections:

1. **Headline trend and source coverage.** Latest common month, YTD read, and
   whether both reporters agree on the direction.
2. **Trend versus prior years.** One line chart of monthly exports/imports plus
   a table of annual and YTD totals, growth rates, and balance.
3. **Product drivers.** Two compact tables: A exports to B / B imports from A,
   and B exports to A / A imports from B. Prefer YTD drivers over latest-month
   drivers unless the latest-month move is the point of the question.
4. **Policy context and caveats.** Current trade agreement status, tariff and
   non-tariff issues, industrial/supply-chain policies, and source asymmetry.
   Publish this section's content as a **`text` panel** (`chart_type:
   "text"` — a title plus a few paragraphs; see the Text panels section of
   `references/output/report-spec.md`), never as a table whose cells are
   sentences.

Keep monthly charts for timing and seasonality. For trade-balance or deficit
tables, follow the granularity note in `references/output/report-spec.md`:
monthly rows for short windows, annual or YTD summaries for long ones.

## Data workflow

1. Call `get_data_catalog` first and skip schemas listed under
   `schemas_without_data`.
2. Use `search_datasets` for both country names plus `trade`, `customs`, and
   `HS`; then `describe_dataset` for each candidate trade dataset.
3. Query each reporter schema separately by default. The `schema` argument
   only sets the default search path; qualified cross-schema references (for
   example `korea_trade.series` from an `india_trade` call) do execute, so a
   `UNION ALL` of per-reporter aggregations in one call is allowed when every
   branch converts to a common unit. The reason to keep reporters separate is
   the data, not the tool: mirror sources differ on units, valuation, timing,
   and definitions, so never mix raw values from two reporters in a single
   expression. Fetch comparable aggregates, normalize units, then compare.
4. For most trade schemas, use `dimensions` to filter partner, flow, commodity,
   and HS level. Eurostat Comext is the exception: never scan its `dimensions`
   table by value. Follow the dedicated Comext workflow in
   `references/data/sql-guide.md`, which searches the product lookup and builds
   exact series IDs.
5. Use exactly one HS level per table. Use HS-6 for cross-country comparison.
   Use national 8/10-digit detail only for within-reporter detail, and never
   sum national-detail rows together with HS-6 rows.
6. Filter value series separately from quantity/weight series. Korea KCS, China
   GACC, Japan Customs, and US Census 10-digit series can include physical
   quantities. A value report should exclude `kg`, quantity, or `_qty` series.
7. Normalize units before comparing reporters. For example, India DGCI&S is
   `US$ Million`; Korea KCS value series are `US$ Thousand`, so divide Korea
   values by 1,000 before comparing them to India values in US$ millions.
8. State reporter/source differences. Mirror statistics often differ because
   of FOB/CIF valuation, timing, exchange-rate conversion, re-exports,
   confidentiality suppressions, revisions, and reporter-specific definitions.
   Do not average reporters by default.

Useful India-South Korea substitutions:

| Reporter view | Schema | Partner filter | HS level | Value units |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| India-reported trade with South Korea | `india_trade` | `partner.dimension_code = '217'` (`KOREA RP`) | `hs_level.dimension_code = '6'` | `US$ Million` |
| Korea-reported trade with India | `korea_trade` | `partner.dimension_code = 'IN'` (`India`) | `hs_level.dimension_code = '6'` | `US$ Thousand`; divide by 1,000 |

## SQL templates

The templates below assume a trade schema with dimensions named `partner`,
`flow`, `commodity`, `hs_level`, and `reporter` (the structure used by
`india_trade`, `korea_trade`, `china_customs`, and similar customs schemas).
They do not apply to `eu_comext_*`; use the indexed Comext template in
`references/data/sql-guide.md` instead.

Replace:

- `<dataset>` with the dataset code, often the same as the schema.
- `<partner_code>` with the code discovered from `dimensions`.
- `<hs_level_code>` with the selected level, usually `6`.
- `<value_units>` with the value unit to keep, such as `US$ Million` or
  `US$ Thousand`.
- `<unit_divisor_to_usd_mn>` with `1` for US$ millions, `1000` for US$
  thousands, and `1000000` for raw US dollars.

### Discover partner, flow, HS, and units

Run this before aggregating so the filters are explicit and auditable:

```sql
SELECT d.dimension_type, d.dimension_code, d.dimension_name, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM dimensions d
JOIN series s USING (series_id)
WHERE s.dataset_code ILIKE '<dataset>'
  AND d.dimension_type IN ('partner', 'flow', 'hs_level', 'reporter')
GROUP BY d.dimension_type, d.dimension_code, d.dimension_name
ORDER BY d.dimension_type, n DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

Then verify value units:

```sql
SELECT measurement_units, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM series
WHERE dataset_code ILIKE '<dataset>'
GROUP BY measurement_units
ORDER BY n DESC;
```

### Monthly totals by flow

This is the base query for line charts, latest-month comparisons, balances, and
annual/YTD tables. The final SELECT returns the latest 24 months so the result
stays under the row cap for two flows; use the aggregate templates below for
longer annual history.

```sql
WITH bilateral_series AS (
  SELECT s.series_id,
         f.dimension_code AS flow_code,
         f.dimension_name AS flow
  FROM series s
  JOIN dimensions p ON p.series_id = s.series_id
      AND p.dimension_type = 'partner'
      AND p.dimension_code = '<partner_code>'
  JOIN dimensions f ON f.series_id = s.series_id
      AND f.dimension_type = 'flow'
  JOIN dimensions h ON h.series_id = s.series_id
      AND h.dimension_type = 'hs_level'
      AND h.dimension_code = '<hs_level_code>'
  WHERE s.dataset_code ILIKE '<dataset>'
    AND s.measurement_units = '<value_units>'
),
monthly AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('month', dp.time)::date AS month,
         bs.flow_code,
         bs.flow,
         SUM(dp.value) / <unit_divisor_to_usd_mn> AS value_usd_mn
  FROM data_points dp
  JOIN bilateral_series bs USING (series_id)
  GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
)
SELECT month, flow_code, flow, value_usd_mn
FROM monthly
WHERE month >= (SELECT MAX(month) FROM monthly) - INTERVAL '24 months'
ORDER BY month, flow_code;
```

Use this output to compute `total_trade = exports + imports` and
`balance = exports - imports` from the reporter's perspective. If exports and
imports have different latest months, use the latest common month for total
trade and balance, then state any source lag.

### Latest common month versus one year earlier

```sql

      AND f.dimension_type = 'flow'

      AND h.dimension_type = 'hs_level'

         ) AS latest_value_usd_mn,
         SUM(m.value_usd_mn) FILTER (
           WHERE m.month = cl.latest_month - INTERVAL '1 year'
         ) AS prior_year_value_usd_mn
  FROM monthly m
  CROSS JOIN common_latest cl
  WHERE m.month IN (cl.latest_month, cl.latest_month - INTERVAL '1 year')
  GROUP BY m.flow_code, m.flow, cl.latest_month

       flow,
       latest_month,

### YTD product drivers by flow

Use this for the driver table. It ranks the largest absolute HS-6 changes
within each flow. Keep both positive and negative changes if they explain the
trend.

```sql

## Policy context

Trade-policy details change, so do current-source work for the policy section.
Use official sources where possible: trade ministries, customs authorities,
WTO, official FTA/CEPA pages, government press releases, and published tariff
or non-tariff measure notices. Cite those pages as `web` sources in the report
or lineage.

For broad trade-policy reports, read `bilateral-economic-policy.md` and expand
this policy section beyond goods. Cover services, FDI/investment, active
bilateral negotiations, standards/certification, sector investment priorities,
and relevant third-country policy pressure, or explicitly state which
dimensions are not available from current data and sources.

For India-South Korea, check current official information on:

- India-Korea CEPA status and any review or upgrade talks.
- Tariff reductions, rules of origin, safeguard measures, anti-dumping or
  countervailing duties, standards, certification, and other non-tariff
  barriers.
- Industrial and supply-chain policies that could affect electronics,
  semiconductors, autos, steel, petrochemicals, critical minerals, batteries,
  and intermediate inputs.
- Whether policy could amplify the observed trend, dampen it, or mainly shift
  product composition rather than total trade.

Keep policy inference separate from measured trade data: say "policy could
support" or "policy could weigh on" unless the data and sources directly prove
causality.

Render the policy discussion as prose — a `text` panel with a clear takeaway
title and a few paragraphs covering the signals, what they mean for the trade
reading, and the caveats. Do not lay it out as an issue/signal/caveat table;
sentence-length cells render badly and the table format adds nothing.

## Report and lineage requirements

- Every numeric claim in the report must come from fetched data in the current
  session.
- Every chart/table should carry database sources for the trade datasets and
  web sources for policy context.
- Lineage must include the actual SQL used for each reporter schema and the
  local computation used to normalize units, calculate YTD/YoY growth, and
  assemble balances.
- If only one reporter is available, still build the trend and driver sections
  from that source, then state that mirror-statistics comparison was not
  available from FactIQ for this pair.
