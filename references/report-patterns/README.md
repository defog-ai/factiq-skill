# Domain Report Patterns — and the Method Behind Them

Each file in this folder is a **domain playbook** for answering a whole class
of broad questions as a complete report. But the folder's real content is a
single method of analysis that every playbook instantiates. Read the method
once; use the routing table to pick a playbook; when no playbook covers the
domain, apply the method directly — it is the playbook generator.

**When to consult this folder:** the question is broad and analytical (a
"discuss / compare / explain / what's driving" question). Read the matching
pattern file **before fetching data** — the method changes what you fetch,
not just how you write it up.

**Before choosing a pattern:** if the request is vague, high-commitment, or
could reasonably become several different reports, run the
explorer-agent interview in `interview-step.md` first. The interview clarifies
scope, audience, detail level, and success criteria; then the selected pattern
still supplies the thesis, antithesis, synthesis, and data work.

**When to skip it:** quick-chart questions ("plot the fed funds rate") and
single-value lookups. Then follow the normal workflow in SKILL.md.

## The method: dialectical analysis

Economic facts are produced by opposing forces. A price is a standoff between
buyer and seller; a policy rate is a wager against market expectations; a
trade statistic is one side's account of a two-sided transaction; a tax
receipt is the residue of a fight between a statute and the taxpayers
arranging their affairs around it. A report that presents only the headline
reading is not neutral — it has silently taken one side of a live argument.

So every report in a covered domain moves through three passes, in the schema
popularly credited to Hegel (his own term for the resolution, *Aufhebung* —
sublation — is the useful one: preserve what is true in each side, cancel
what is naive, lift the claim to the level where the tension resolves):

### 1. Thesis — the strongest surface reading

Fetch the headline series and state what it appears to say, at full strength.
Steelman it — a weak thesis makes the whole exercise theater. This is the
official narrative, the consensus view, the number a wire story would lead
with. In investment terms: what is already priced in.

### 2. Antithesis — the strongest contradiction, fetched, not footnoted

Now build the best case *against* the thesis from the data. This is the pass
most analysis skips, and it is the pass that produces every finding worth
publishing. The antithesis must be **fetched** — it changes the SQL you run —
not gestured at in a caveats paragraph. The recurring moves:

| Move | Question it asks | Typical fetch |
|---|---|---|
| **Measurement** | What does this statistic fail to see? | Alternative measures (U-6 beside U-3), mirror statistics, revision history, coverage notes |
| **Composition** | Does the aggregate hide divergence? | Disaggregate — by sector, income bracket, HS chapter, firm size, region |
| **Deflation** | Is this quantity or just price? Nominal or real? | Real/volume series, deflators, value-vs-quantity splits |
| **Counterparty** | What does the other side's ledger say? | Partner-reported flows, the borrower's balance sheet to the lender's, the market's pricing of the policymaker's promise |
| **Reaction** | What counter-move has measurement or policy provoked? (Goodhart's law; the Lucas critique) | Rerouted trade after tariffs, timing shifts after tax changes, financial conditions easing under "restrictive" rates |
| **Baseline** | Is the change real or an artifact of the comparison window? | Longer windows, pre-shock baselines, same-month rather than adjacent-month comparisons |

Each playbook in this folder is, concretely, a catalog of its domain's
canonical antitheses plus tested SQL to fetch them. That is what "required
coverage" means: the contradictions a competent skeptic would raise, gathered
in advance.

### 3. Synthesis — one claim that explains both sides

Juxtaposition is not synthesis. "On the one hand X, on the other hand Y" is
an unfinished report. The synthesis is a single, higher-order claim under
which the headline *and* its contradiction are both true and both explained:
not "trade fell, but rerouting complicates the picture" but "the supply chain
did not decouple — it lengthened, and the direct-flow decline measures the
detour, not the divorce."

The synthesis is what goes in the report summary and the chart titles. And it
is provisional — today's synthesis is tomorrow's thesis (stability breeds the
instability that ends it, as Minsky put it), so close with **what to watch**:
the one or two series that would falsify your reading and when they next
print.

**The test:** if deleting your antithesis fetches would leave your summary
unchanged, you did not do the method — you decorated the thesis.

## The dialectic by domain — routing table

| Domain (triggers) | Thesis — the headline says | Canonical antitheses | The synthesis names | Playbook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bilateral merchandise trade** — "trend in trade between A and B", trade balance, HS/customs drivers | Flows between A and B rose/fell X% | Mirror statistics disagree; price moves masquerading as demand (value vs volume); rerouting through third countries; one HS chapter carrying the aggregate | What the relationship is actually doing — decoupling, lengthening, or repricing | `bilateral-trade.md` |
| **Bilateral economic policy** — "compare A and B trade policy", joint economic policy, investment/supply-chain coordination | Stated policy: communiqués, announced tariffs, talks | Revealed behavior contradicts rhetoric (cooperation language beside tightening FDI screens); goods data standing in for services and investment; third-country pressure driving the pair | The actual policy equilibrium versus the stated one | `bilateral-economic-policy.md` |
| **Monetary policy** — central-bank stance, implementation, OMO, liquidity, transmission, FX intervention | The stance as announced: rate level, path, communication | Implementation diverges from announcement (reserves, corridor, standing facilities); transmission fails (financial conditions ease under high rates); the curve prices what the bank won't promise; FX intervention unsterilized against the stance | The *effective* stance — how tight policy is where it touches the economy | `monetary-policy.md` |
| **Fiscal policy / revenue** — tax vs non-tax receipts, revenue by bracket or firm size, promise-vs-outcome | Receipts are up/down; the policy worked/failed | Inflation did the taxing (bracket creep, nominal base growth); composition shifted — who actually paid; one-offs and timing pull-forwards; promises measured against outcomes | The structural revenue story beneath the cyclical one, and whose burden moved | `fiscal-policy-revenue.md` |
| **Business formation** (Census BFS) — applications by industry/NAICS, implications | An application boom signals dynamism | High-propensity share says how many are paper entities; necessity entrepreneurship (layoffs minting LLCs); growth pooled in low-barrier industries; churn offsets entry | What *kind* of dynamism, and whether it can become employers and competition | `business-formation-statistics.md` |
| **Earnings intelligence / company analysis** — "what did X say on the call", earnings notes, guidance scorecards, cross-company themes, "is the story consistent with the data" | The narrative management tells on the call, and the consensus around it | Filed actuals vs spoken claims; disclosure behavior (what they withhold or stopped mentioning); the Q&A pressure map and refused numbers; the macro series behind every macro claim | What the narrative gets right, where it flatters, and the named falsifiers to watch | `earnings-intelligence.md` |
| **Executive media intelligence** — podcasts, TV interviews, conferences, executive theme sweeps or timelines, media-vs-earnings comparisons | The public position an executive presents outside earnings calls | Structured-corpus coverage and lexical misses; claims vs broad passages; venue/audience/date differences; independently checked earnings quotes vs media paraphrases | What is genuinely consistent or changed across venues, without mistaking paraphrase wording for tone | `media-intelligence.md` |

Disambiguation for country-pair questions: goods-specific wording ("goods
trade", "exports/imports", "trade balance", "HS", "customs", "product
drivers") routes to `bilateral-trade.md`; broad policy wording ("trade
policy", "economic policy", "joint policy") routes to
`bilateral-economic-policy.md`, which pulls in `bilateral-trade.md` for the
merchandise-goods portion only.

## Domains without a playbook

Apply the method directly — the table above shows the shape a domain
instantiation takes. The frequent case:

- **Macro questions generally** (labor, inflation, housing, energy). Thesis:
  the headline print. Antithesis: run the six moves in the table — measure,
  compose, deflate, cross-check the counterparty, look for the reaction,
  re-baseline. Synthesis: the claim that survives all six, plus what to
  watch.

## Rules the method implies

- **Report mode by default.** A question matching a pattern gets a compact
  multi-section report, not one chart, unless the user explicitly requests one.
- **Cover the full concept.** Reducing a broad question to its easiest slice
  (monetary policy → just the rate path; trade policy → just goods flows) is
  skipping the antithesis pass by construction.
- **An antithesis you cannot fetch is disclosed, not dropped.** When the
  warehouse lacks a required counter-check (current OMO detail, services
  trade, distributional tax data), say so in the report — a named data gap is
  itself a finding about how confident the synthesis can be.
- **Measured vs inferred, always labeled.** Thesis and antithesis are fetched
  numbers; the synthesis is interpretation and must be presented as such,
  resting explicitly on the evidence from both passes.
- **Read `references/output/report-spec.md`** before authoring the report
  object — the patterns govern the data work and the argument; the spec
  governs the JSON format, sources, and lineage.

## Adding a new pattern

A playbook is a domain's dialectic written down in advance: a trigger section
(which question shapes it covers), the domain's canonical antitheses as
required coverage, tested SQL templates against the three-table schema to
fetch them, and the caveats/guardrails that keep the synthesis honest. Add
one row to the routing table above — SKILL.md points here and does not need
to change.
