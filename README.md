# FactIQ - a real-time finance and economy database for AI Agents

Turn your agent into a finance and economy analyst. This plugin for
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) and
[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) gives the agent direct access to
FactIQ's warehouse of official statistics — SEC filings, US, China, India, Korea, IMF,
World Bank, and more — plus live market data, earnings-call transcripts,
executive media appearances, and satellite-derived data (fire detections,
air-quality activity signals,
rainfall, nighttime lights, shipping and port activity, reservoir levels).
The agent discovers series, runs read-only SQL, computes derived metrics, and
returns a sourced answer, terminal preview, report JSON, or bespoke local HTML
visualization.

No codebase or hosted database is required — only a free
[FactIQ account](https://factiq.com).

Want to contribute? The highest-leverage addition is a **domain playbook** that
teaches the agent a whole class of questions — see
[Contributing](#contributing).

## Install

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add defog-ai/factiq-plugin
/plugin install factiq@factiq
/reload-plugins
```

Run **`/reload-plugins`** after installing so Claude Code picks up the new
skill, MCP server, and command in the current session (otherwise they only
appear the next time you start Claude Code).

This adds the skill (Claude invokes it automatically for economic/financial
data questions), the bundled FactIQ MCP server, and the `/factiq:ask` command:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/factiq:ask <question>` | Run a full analysis and get a shareable chart, terminal chart, or report |

Finally, authenticate the MCP server:

1. Run **`/mcp`**.
2. Select **factiq** from the list of servers.
3. Choose **Authenticate** (or **Connect**) to open the browser sign-in.
4. Complete the FactIQ login (email, Google, or passkey) and return to Claude
   Code — the FactIQ tools are now authorized.

<details>
<summary>Enable auto-updates</summary>

So you always get the latest skill, MCP tools, and commands without
reinstalling, turn on auto-updates for the marketplace:

1. Run **`/plugin`**.
2. Select **Marketplaces**.
3. Select **factiq**.
4. Toggle **auto-updates** on.

Claude Code will then refresh the plugin automatically whenever this
marketplace changes.
</details>

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add defog-ai/factiq-plugin
codex plugin add factiq@factiq
```

Then authorize the MCP server:

```bash
codex mcp login factiq
```

Complete the browser sign-in (the same FactIQ login: email, Google, or
passkey). Start a new Codex thread after installation; the skill auto-invokes
for economic/financial data questions.

<details>
<summary>Update an existing Codex install</summary>

To update after this marketplace changes, refresh the configured marketplace
name (`factiq`), then reinstall the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade factiq
codex plugin add factiq@factiq
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Alternative: install as a standalone MCP server (no plugin)</summary>

Add the MCP server directly to your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.factiq]
url = "https://api.factiq.com/mcp"
```

Then `codex mcp login factiq`. The skill won't auto-invoke without the plugin,
but the MCP tools are available for manual use.

For Claude Code without the plugin:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http factiq https://api.factiq.com/mcp
```

Then authorize with `/mcp`.
</details>

## Try it

Once installed and authenticated, ask a question:

```
/factiq:ask How has India's trade deficit with China evolved since 2020?
```

The agent finds the relevant series, runs the SQL, and replies with a
shareable factiq.com chart link — or a terminal chart or full report,
depending on what you ask for. You don't need the slash command: any
economic or financial data question in a normal Claude Code or Codex
conversation auto-invokes the skill.

For an earnings question such as "What did Micron management say on its latest
call?", the skill checks live transcript coverage first, pins the exact fiscal
quarter, and then retrieves bounded management-claim and Q&A-pressure rows for
that same call. It keeps spoken remarks separate from formal guidance and SEC
filed actuals; the tool does not return a raw transcript.

For a media question such as "How has Jensen Huang discussed export controls
outside earnings calls?", the skill checks company-level structured coverage,
runs deterministic lexical retrieval with relevance ordering, and uses explicit
newest ordering only for a timeline. Results are public-safe paraphrases with
timestamped YouTube links, not quotations; the workflow verifies the linked
source when exact wording or tone is material. A dedicated playbook also keeps
media-vs-earnings comparisons aligned by company, person, topic, and date.

## How it works

**Your coding agent is the analyst**: it finds the data, does the math, and
authors a local output. Data access uses the **FactIQ MCP server** bundled in
`.mcp.json` over one OAuth connection.

```

The reason a single skill can query BLS unemployment, Chinese customs flows,
RBI monetary data, and World Bank indicators with the same SQL idioms: **every
data source in the backend is normalized into the same three core tables**,
identical in every schema:

| Table | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `series` | The catalog — one row per series: id, title, description, dataset, frequency, units, seasonality, geography, time coverage |
| `data_points` | The values — `(series_id, time, value)`, indexed for fast retrieval |
| `dimensions` | Faceted metadata — `(series_id, dimension_type, dimension_code, dimension_name)`, e.g. `partner`, `flow`, `commodity`, `hs_level` for trade data |

Our ingestion pipelines do the hard work of flattening each source's bespoke
format — BLS flat files, BEA APIs, customs records, RBI releases — into this
shape, so the agent learns the model once and it works everywhere. Discovery,
pivoting, and filtering follow the same patterns across all ~20 schemas; the
recipes live in [`references/data/sql-guide.md`](references/data/sql-guide.md).

### What's in the warehouse

| Region | Schemas |
|---|---|
| United States | SEC filings data, BLS (employment, CPI, JOLTS, OEWS), Census (trade incl. HS-level, retail, housing), BEA (GDP, income), EIA (energy), USDA ERS, BTS (transportation), earnings-call transcripts, executive media appearances |
| China | NBS macro indicators, GACC customs (HS-level trade) |
| India | MOSPI (CPI, WPI, IIP, GDP), RBI (banking, rates, forex), DGCI&S trade (HS-level), Bengaluru road traffic (2026 onward, that one city only) |
| South Korea | KCS customs (HS-level trade) |
| European Union | Eurostat Comext monthly trade for all 27 member-state reporters, by CN8 product and partner country |
| Global | IMF (including the recent earlier releases of its forecasts, so a revision can be traced), World Bank, Singapore SingStat, live market data (quotes, fundamentals, FX, commodities) |

`references/data/schemas.md` has the static overview; the `get_data_catalog` tool
returns the live, authoritative version.

## Repo map

Where the behavior lives — the files contributors will touch:

- `skills/factiq/SKILL.md` — the skill definition and single source of truth
  for the workflow. Auto-discovered by both Claude Code and Codex from the
  `skills/` directory
- `references/data/` — the data layer: SQL idioms (`sql-guide.md`) and the
  dataset schema overview (`schemas.md`)
- `references/output/` — local output formats: ChartSpec (`chart-spec.md`),
  report JSON (`report-spec.md`), and the bespoke-viz guide (`viz-guide.md`)
- `references/report-patterns/` — domain playbooks (monetary policy,
  bilateral trade, bilateral economic policy, fiscal-policy revenue, business
  formation, earnings intelligence, media-appearance intelligence).
  `report-patterns/README.md` is the single entry point SKILL.md
  references: it teaches the dialectical method (thesis → antithesis →
  synthesis) all reports follow and routes each domain to its playbook, so
  adding a playbook doesn't touch SKILL.md
- `commands/ask.md` — the `/factiq:ask` slash command (Claude Code)
- `scripts/term_chart.py` — stdlib-only renderer for ANSI/ASCII previews from
  FactIQ ChartSpec and report JSON objects. It supports bar, simple line, and
  table fallback renderers
- `scripts/build_viz.py` — local-only tool that assembles fetched data into a
  self-contained HTML viz and screenshots it headless for iteration; usage in
  [`references/output/viz-guide.md`](references/output/viz-guide.md)
- `assets/viz-shell.html` — starting-point shell for bespoke visualizations

Plugin plumbing — you shouldn't need to touch these:

- `.mcp.json` — declares the bundled FactIQ MCP server (Streamable HTTP,
  OAuth). Read by both Claude Code and Codex plugin loaders
- `.claude-plugin/` — Claude Code plugin + marketplace manifests
- `.codex-plugin/` — Codex plugin manifest
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` — Codex marketplace entry for
  `codex plugin marketplace add defog-ai/factiq-plugin`

### Bespoke skills (domain playbooks) — the highest-leverage contribution

The most valuable thing you can add is a **domain playbook**: a reference file
that teaches the agent how to answer a whole class of questions well. A
playbook is a domain's dialectic written down in advance — the headline
reading a question invites, the contradictions a competent skeptic would
raise against it, and the SQL to fetch both (see the method in
[`references/report-patterns/README.md`](references/report-patterns/README.md)).
The existing ones live in
[`references/report-patterns/`](references/report-patterns/) and are the
pattern to follow:

- [`monetary-policy.md`](references/report-patterns/monetary-policy.md) —
  central bank policy stance, administered rates, OMO, balance-sheet context
- [`bilateral-trade.md`](references/report-patterns/bilateral-trade.md) —
  country-pair trade trends, product drivers, mirror-statistics caveats
- [`fiscal-policy-revenue.md`](references/report-patterns/fiscal-policy-revenue.md)
  — government receipts, tax composition, distributional detail

A good playbook contains:

1. **A trigger** — which question shapes it covers ("latest trend in trade
   between A and B", "explain the Fed's stance"), added as a row to the
   routing table in
   [`references/report-patterns/README.md`](references/report-patterns/README.md)
   so the agent reads the playbook *before* fetching. `SKILL.md` points at
   that router, so it doesn't need to change.
2. **Required coverage** — the domain's canonical antitheses: the
   counter-checks a complete answer must fetch (mirror statistics, real vs
   nominal, composition, the counterparty's ledger), so the agent doesn't
   stop at the first obvious chart.
3. **Ready SQL templates** — tested queries against the three-table schema for
   the key computations (latest-month YoY, YTD comparisons, top-N drivers).
4. **Caveats and guardrails** — unit normalization, base-year changes,
   national-vs-subnational traps, data gaps to disclose explicitly.

Ideas we'd love to see: labor-market health, inflation decomposition, energy
markets, housing, sovereign debt, sector earnings analysis, country
macro-risk snapshots.

### Other welcome contributions

- **Terminal renderers** — new chart types or better ASCII/ANSI output in
  `scripts/term_chart.py` (keep it stdlib-only).
- **Viz recipes** — reusable patterns for `build_viz.py` and
  `references/output/viz-guide.md`.
- **SQL idioms and pitfalls** — additions to `references/data/sql-guide.md`
  from real usage.
- **Docs and fixes** — anything that makes the agent's first attempt land.

Test a playbook by running its questions end to end and checking the saved
chart or report output. Include exact before-and-after examples in the PR.

## Security

No secrets belong in this repo, and the plugin holds none — all access goes
through the MCP server's OAuth flow, so the coding agent holds the token and
nothing is written here. All SQL runs read-only against FactIQ's data warehouse.
